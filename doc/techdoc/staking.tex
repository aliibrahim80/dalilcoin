The file {\file{qeditasstk.ml}} has code to execute a staking process.
It creates an executable {\exec{qeditasstk}}
which is started by {\exec{qeditasd}}
and runs in an independent process. It is sent the block height, target information
and stake modifier through standard input. It is also sent a list of assets
which can be used for staking
and storage assets which can be used to enhance staking.
The process then keeps checking to see if one of the
assets leads to a ``hit.'' When it finds a ``hit'' it reports this to
the parent via standard out.
